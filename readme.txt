Cart Deals is many plugins in one!
 
*   *Cart Discounts*
     - Dynamic pricing in the cart, by just about any grouping or deal you can think of.
*   *Sale Pricing*
     - Use a single rule to put an entire Category (or other group) on sale.  Just like having a sale price on a product, except
     -    a single rule can apply to a big group, without updating each product individually!!!       
*   *Marketing*
     - Advertise your Deals using Shortcodes!
*   *by Category*
     - Example: "T-Shirts 10% off - 1 day sale"   
*   *Role Pricing*
    - Example: "Members get 20% off"
*   *Customer Limits*
     - Example: "One per customer"
