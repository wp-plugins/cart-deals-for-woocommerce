     //RULE INTERACTIONS - CUMULATIVE PRICING  => Dynamic Pricing now supports cumulative rule processing via a configurable filter. When dynamic pricing processes the discount rules to apply, it will first check if the item is discounted by some other rule. If the item has already been discounted, a filter will be called allowing you to configure the cumulative nature of the processing. If you choose, you can have dynamic pricing either stop processing and only apply the discounts applied prior, or allowing dynamic pricing to continue processing the cumulative discount. A useful example is to give Members 10% off all items in your catalog, and an additional 50% a special item for members. This is just one use case, however with this new functionality, more powerful and easier to configure discount situations are possibile.
